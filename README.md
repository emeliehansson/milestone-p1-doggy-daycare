# Portfolio Project 1 - Doggy Daycare

The Doggy Daycare is a website for dog owners. Users that visit this webpage are looking for a place to leave their dogs when they are at work or on vacation. 

The users can on this website find information about the daycare, what services they offer, pricing, open times, contact information, the location, a signup form and they can also see photos from the daycare.
