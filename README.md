# Portfolio Project 1 - Doggy Daycare

The Doggy Daycare is a website for dog owners. Users that visit this webpage are looking for a place to leave their dogs when they are at work or on vacation. 

The users can on this website find information about the daycare, what services they offer, pricing, open times, contact information, the location, a signup form and they can also see photos from the daycare.

## Wireframes

Before starting the project I created a basic wireframe to have an idea of what my project would look like.

## Features
---

### Navigation bar:
-   At the top of the page there is a logo with the name of the daycare: DOGGY DAYCARE, that links to the top of the page.
-	Three of the other navigation links are found directly beneath the logo: Gallery, Services and Application. Gallery links to a another page, Services and Application links to sections on the same page. 
-	The navigation bar makes it easier for the user to find the information of the different sections of the website. 
-	The navigation is in a font that is easy to read and in a color that contrasts with the background.

### Open Times Section
- This part of the website is very straight forward: here the user can find the open times for the daycare, for when they can drop off and pick up their dog during the week.
- It also gives the user information about that the daycare can be open on the weekends as well, upon agreement.

-	This section shows the user the information they need to have about the daycare to be able to decide about applying. 
-   In this section the owners of the dogs can also read about what extras they offer, things that can make it easier for the owner.
    Such as that the daycare can give the dog a bath for them.

-	In this section the owner also has to let the daycare know how much they want to leave their dog at the daycare.

## Testing (done before first submission, (second part of testing shown further down in README.))
-   I have tested that this page works on: Google Chrome and Safari.
-   I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screens using the devtools device toolbar.
-   I confirmed that navigation, about us, signup and application are all readable and easy to understand.

### Bugs
-   My accessibility score was lower on the first test, I had missed connecting the labels to an input, inside the form. After that the score was better.

### Validator Testing 
-   HTML: 
    When I tested my code in the HTML validator I saw that I had missed adding a space beetween attributes. Solved by adding a space.
    Otherwise no errors were found.

![Fixed Bug](readme-images/Ska%CC%88rmavbild%202022-09-16%20kl.%2012.32.22.png)

-   CSS:
    No errors were found when passing through the official (JigSaw) Validator.

-   Accessibility: 
    I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools. 

![Lighthouse](readme-images/Ska%CC%88rmavbild%202022-09-16%20kl.%2012.42.18.png)

### Unfixed Bugs
-   Unfortunately the Performance part of the Lighthouse check was not good. So this would be something I would have to look further into.
