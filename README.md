# Portfolio Project 1 - Doggy Daycare

The Doggy Daycare is a website for dog owners. Users that visit this webpage are looking for a place to leave their dogs when they are at work or on vacation. 

The users can on this website find information about the daycare, what services they offer, pricing, open times, contact information, the location, a signup form and they can also see photos from the daycare.

## Wireframes

Before starting the project I created a basic wireframe to have an idea of what my project would look like.

## Features

### Navigation bar:
-   At the top of the page there is a logo with the name of the daycare: DOGGY DAYCARE, that links to the top of the page.
-	Three of the other navigation links are found directly beneath the logo: Gallery, Services and Application. Gallery links to a another page, Services and Application links to sections on the same page. 
-	The navigation bar makes it easier for the user to find the information of the different sections of the website. 
-	The navigation is in a font that is easy to read and in a color that contrasts with the background.

## Testing
-   I have tested that this page works on: Google Chrome and Safari.
-   I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screens using the devtools device toolbar.
-   I confirmed that navigation, about us, signup and application are all readable and easy to understand.

### Bugs
-   My accessibility score was lower on the first test, I had missed connecting the labels to an input, inside the form. After that the score was better.

## Validator 
-   HTML: 
    When I tested my code in the HTML validator I saw that I had missed adding a space beetween attributes. Solved by adding a space.
    Otherwise no errors were found.
